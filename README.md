# MATH60082-environment
This repository specifies the environment (which python packages are available, for example) for the Jupyter notebooks associated with MATH4/60082: Computational, but does nothing more. It's part of a strategy to get quicker launches on Binder by separating the environment set-up from the notebooks themselves: see the forum posts
[How to reduce mybinder.org repository startup time](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/how-to-reduce-mybinder-org-repository-startup-time/4956) and [Tip: speed up Binder launches by pulling github content in a Binder link with nbgitpuller](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/tip-speed-up-binder-launches-by-pulling-github-content-in-a-binder-link-with-nbgitpuller/922) for details.
